Description: This package provides peer-rated data on 17 psycho-social, economic, 
    or other individual-level traits on a sample of 60 adults from a Chabu community. 
    The Chabu are forager-horticulturalists residing in remote forest villages in Southwest Ethiopia. 
    These data were collected in 2016 by ZHG and initially reported in The Leadership Quarterly, 
    Garfield & Hagen (2020).
